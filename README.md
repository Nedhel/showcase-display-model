This is the final assignment of the firs course.
This is a site with 5 pages, each one showing a different layout: box-model, box-model how works, flexbox,float left, float right.
I copied the teacher's design, but you should put the pointer on the left side of the screen and see the trick!!

--Addition--
The firs design was about showing a different layout on each page, but for this version teacher asked for a responsive design, that is why I change layout in some
